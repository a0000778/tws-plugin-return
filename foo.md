Hello, minimal discord support added.

you can now /connect-discord -> /connect-discord-confirm
this links you tws account and discord account

the link is made visible in the chat bridge and you username also gets
traslated so discord users will see your discord username when sending
messages from mindustry and vice versa.

Right now, only test-bot has these capabilities.
